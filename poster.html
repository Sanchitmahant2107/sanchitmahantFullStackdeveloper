                    country primarily located in North America. It is a federation of 50 states, a federal capital
                    district
                    (Washington, D.C.), and 326 Indian reservations.[j] Outside the union of states, it asserts

                    over
                    five major unincorporated island territories and various uninhabited islands.[k] The country has the

                    Paleo-Indians migrated across the Bering land bridge more than 12,000 years ago. British

                    led to the
                    first settlement of the Thirteen Colonies in Virginia in 1607. Clashes with the British Crown over
                    taxation and
                    political representation sparked the American Revolution, with the Second Continental Congress
                    formally
                    declaring independence on July 4, 1776. Following its victory in the Revolutionary War (1775–1783),

                    the 16th century, British and French expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic

                    was
                    formed as a federal dominion of four provinces. This began an accretion of provinces and territories

                    a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom, highlighted by the Statute of Westminster,
                    1931, and culminating in the Canada Act 1982, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the
                    Parliament of the United Kingdom.

                    west by the Sea of Japan, extending from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north toward the East China Sea,
                    Philippine Sea, and Taiwan in the south. Japan is a part of the Ring of Fire, and spans an
                    archipelago
                    of 14,125 islands, with the four main islands being Hokkaido, Honshu (the "mainland"), Shikoku, and
                    Kyushu. Tokyo is the country's capital and largest city, followed by Yokohama, Osaka, Nagoya,
                    Sapporo,
                    Fukuoka, Kobe, and Kyoto.

                    The Japanese archipelago has been inhabited since the Upper Paleolithic (30,000 BC). Between the
                    fourth
                    and ninth centuries AD, the kingdoms of the region became unified under an emperor and the imperial
                    court based in Heian-kyō. Beginning in the 12th century, political power was held by a series of
                    military dictators (shōgun) and feudal lords (daimyō), and enforced by a class of warrior nobility
                    (samurai). After a century-long period of civil war, the country was reunified in 1603 under the
                    Tokugawa shogunate, which enacted an isolationist foreign policy. In 1854, a United States fleet
                    forced
                    Japan to open trade to the West, which led to the end of the shogunate and the restoration of
                    imperial

                                country located in
                                west-central Europe.[d][13] It is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west,
                                Germany to the north and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is
                                geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura; the Alps occupy
                                the
                                greater part of the territory, whereas most of the country's population of 9 million are
                                concentrated on the plateau, which hosts its largest cities and economic centres,
                                including
                                Zürich, Geneva, and Basel.[14] <br />

                                Switzerland originates from the Old Swiss Confederacy established in the Late Middle
                                Ages,
                                following a series of military successes against Austria and Burgundy; the Federal
                                Charter
                                of 1291 is considered the country's founding document. Swiss independence from the Holy
                                Roman Empire was formally recognised in the Peace of Westphalia in 1648. Switzerland has
                                maintained a policy of armed neutrality since the 16th century and has not fought an
                                international war since 1815. It joined the United Nations only in 2002 but pursues an
                                active foreign policy that includes frequent involvement in peace building.[15]</b></i>

                                in
                                South Asia. It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the
                                Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and

                                to the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the

                                including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest
                                mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the

                                capital and the largest city. Nepal is a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual, multi-religious

                                The name "Nepal" is first recorded in texts from the Vedic period of the Indian
                                subcontinent, the era in ancient Nepal when Hinduism was founded, the predominant
                                religion
                                of the country. In the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of
                                Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were
                                intertwined
                                with the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with
