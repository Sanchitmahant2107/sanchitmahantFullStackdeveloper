        and the former captain of the Indian national cricket team. He is a right-handed batsman and an occasional
        medium-fast bowler. He currently represents Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL and Delhi in domestic

        highest run-scorer in T20I and IPL, ranks third in ODI, and stands as the fourth-highest in international
        cricket.[5] He also holds the record for scoring the most centuries in ODI cricket and stands second in the list
        of most international centuries scored. Kohli was a key member of the Indian team that won the 2011 Cricket
        World Cup, 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, and captained India to win the ICC Test mace three consecutive times in
