                Gāṁdhī;[pron 1]
                October 1869 – 30 January 1948)
                was an
                Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to
                lead the
                successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights
                and
                freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit 'great-souled, venerable'), first applied
                to him
                in South Africa in 1914, is now used throughout the world.<br>[2
                Born and raised in a Hindu family in coastal Gujarat, Gandhi trained in the law at the Inner Temple in
                London
                and was called to the bar in June 1891, at the age of 22. After two uncertain years in India, where he
                was
                unable to start a successful law practice, Gandhi moved to South Africa in 1893 to represent an Indian
                merchant
                in a lawsuit. He went on to live in South Africa for 21 years. There, Gandhi raised a family and first
                employed
                nonviolent resistance in a campaign for civil rights. In 1915, aged 45, he returned to India and soon
                set about
                organising peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against discrimination and excessive
                land-tax.</i></b>

    <p style="font-size: larger; color: white;"><b><i>Bhagat Singh (28 September 1907[1] – 23 March 1931) was an Indian
                anti-colonial
                revolutionary,[3] who
                participated in the mistaken murder of a junior British police officer in December 1928[4] in what was
                to be
                retaliation for the death of an Indian nationalist.[5] He later took part in a largely symbolic bombing
                of
                the
                Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi and a hunger strike in jail, which—on the back of sympathetic
                coverage in
                Indian-owned newspapers—turned him into a household name in the Punjab region, and after his execution
                at age 23
                into a martyr and folk hero in Northern India.[6] Borrowing ideas from Bolshevism and anarchism,[7] the
                charismatic Singh[8] electrified a growing militancy in India in the 1930s, and prompted urgent
                introspection
                within the Indian National Congress's nonviolent but eventually successful campaign for India's
                independence.</i></b>[9]

    <p style="font-size: larger; color: white;"><b><i>Pratap Singh I (Hindi pronunciation: [Mahārāṇā pratāp] ⓘ; c. 9 May
                1540 – 19
                January 1597), popularly known
                as
                Maharana Pratap, was a king of Kingdom of Mewar, in north-western India in the present-day state of
                Rajasthan.
                He is notable for leading the Rajput resistance against the expansionist policy of the Mughal Emperor
                Akbar
                including the Battle of Haldighati.

                Early life and accession
                Maharana Pratap was born to Udai Singh II of Mewar and Jaiwanta Bai in 1540, the year in which Udai
                Singh
                ascended to the throne after defeating Vanvir Singh.[5][6][7] His younger brothers were Shakti Singh,
                Vikram
                Singh and Jagmal Singh. Pratap also had two stepsisters: Chand Kanwar and Man Kanwar. His chief consort
                was
                Ajabde Bai Punwar of Bijolia.[8] Their eldest son was Amar Singh I.[9] He belonged to the royal family
                of
                Mewar.<br>[10] After the death of Udai Singh in 1572, Rani Dheer Bai Bhatiyani wanted her son Jagmal to
                succeed
                him[11] but senior courtiers preferred Pratap, as the eldest son, to be their king. The desire of the
                nobles
                prevailed and Pratap ascended the throne as Maharana Pratap, the 54th ruler of Mewar in the line of the
                Sisodia
                Rajputs.[12] He was crowned in Gogunda on the auspicious day of Holi. Jagmal swore revenge and left for
                Ajmer,
                to join the armies of Akbar, and obtained the town of Jahazpur as a Jagir as a gift in return for his
                help.[13]</i></b>

                1689. He was the eldest son of Shivaji, the founder of the Maratha Kingdom. Sambhaji's rule was largely
                shaped by the ongoing wars between the Marathas and the Mughal Empire, as well as other neighbouring
                powers
                such as the Abyssinians of Janjira, Wadiyars of Mysore and the Portuguese Empire in Goa. After
                Sambhaji's
                execution by Aurangzeb, his brother Rajaram I succeeded him as the next Chhatrapati and continued the
                Mughal–Maratha Wars.</i>[1]
