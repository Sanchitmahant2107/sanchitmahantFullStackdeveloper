    <p>The Royal Enfield Bullet was an overhead valve, single-cylinder, four-stroke motorcycle initially made by Royal
        Enfield in Redditch, Worcestershire England. It was later produced by Royal Enfield (India) at Chennai, Tamil
        Nadu, India, a company originally founded by Madras Motors to build Royal Enfield motorcycles under licence in
        India. The Royal Enfield Bullet has the longest and unchanged production run of any motorcycle having remained
        continuously in production since 1948.[1][2] The Bullet marque is even older and has passed 75 years of
        continuous production. The Royal Enfield and Bullet names were derived from the British company which had been a
        subcontractor to the Royal Small Arms Factory in Enfield, Londo</p>
